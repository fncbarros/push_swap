# push_swap
Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program using Push_swap instruction language that sorts the integer arguments received.
Implemented radix sort to the bit level. Number of operations is only dependent on number of elements and not configuration, so results tend to repeat. Performance gets better as number of elements grows.

Implemented doubly linked lists holding an int value and specified functions for it
Struct holds both stack a and b.
Not using most of the operations so not the most efficient algo
Failling in cases like taking arguments of the sort "1-1"

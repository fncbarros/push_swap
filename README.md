# push_swap
Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program using Push_swap instruction language that sorts the integer arguments received.

/2nd_impl/  (2nd iplementation of the project or Plan B):
Update libft to implement doubly linked lists holding an int value
Update push_swap.h struct to hold both stacks in order to pass less parameters to functions and overall easier execution
